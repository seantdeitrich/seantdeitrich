# Greetings and Salutations Friend-O! My name is Sean.

## About Me:

I'm a disc-golf loving Computer Science Teacher at Porter-Gaud in Charleston, SC.
I inspire my students to fall in love with Computer Science through creative hands-on projects focusing on making a positive impact in the world. 
A few examples of projects my students have made include video games on raising LGBTQ+ awareness, websites on reversing global warming, and virtual reality applications on curing cancer. In 2021, 23 of my students won awards from the National Center for Women & Information Technology because of their incredible hard work and creativity.


## About this Repository:

This repository hosts my personal website, online resume, and a link to my Dungeons and Dragons campaign (when it's active).
It is currently under development as I am exploring ThreeJS and Blender. It will certainly be imperfect and full of mistakes, but I want to give an accurate reflection of my journey in the learning process.
